            <p1>Hi everyone! My name is Ella Galbraith! My major is Software Egineering! I'm from a small town in Missouri and I actually live near a lot of church sites. I like to read, hike, camp, and spend quality time with friends and family! My favorite food is 100% ice cream. I am excited to learn and get to know everyone this semester. Good luck everyone!!</p1>
